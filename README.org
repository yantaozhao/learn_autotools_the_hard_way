* learn autotools the practical way

** executable
- [X] hello world: single file  [helloworld_s]
- [X] hello world: multiple files  [helloworld_m1, helloworld_m2]
- [ ] +hello world: multiple files, multiple makefiles+
- [ ] generate multiple executable files


** library
- [X] static library: single file  [library_s1, library_s2]
- [X] shared library: single file  [library_s1, library_s2]
- [ ] static library: multiple files
- [ ] static library: multiple files, multiple makefiles
- [ ] generate multiple static libraries.
- [ ] shared library: multiple files
- [ ] shared library: multiple files, multiple makefiles
- [ ] generate multiple shared libraries.
- [X] library, linking against other libraries  [library_linking_libraries_a_a, library_linking_libraries_so_ca]


** executable & library
- [X] hello world: linking against static library  [helloworld_linking_a]
- [X] hello world: linking against shared library  [helloworld_linking_so1]
- [ ] +static library, linking against shared library+
- [ ] +shared library, linking against static library+
